## My process

Identify core functionality, pieces of the desing that can be broken into smaller components. Implement the base styling first so that I could focus on the functionality after. Added the actual age calculating functionality, then added validation on top that. Go back and tweak styling to accomodate the now functional error states.

### Built with

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend project scaffolding.
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript Library.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Strongly typed JavaScript.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://styled-components.com/) - For styling.
- [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) - Made age calculation relatively simple.

### What I learned

This project was mainly for the purpose of introducing me to a few tools that I have been wanting to try out. Specifically Vite, and Tailwind.
